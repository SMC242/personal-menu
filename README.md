This is a skeuomorphic recipe book that I made for my partner using React, Astro, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. The codebase is not the best but it was a great CSS challenge and I learned a lot from it. Additionally, it was exciting to work with the new [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) now that Firefox has finally added support for it.

# Features

- Skeuomorphic design and animations
- Mobile-first design
- Filtering recipes by tags
- The use of Astro makes composing new entries simple, with very little boilerplate

## Planned updates

1. Recipe name search
2. A little dancing elephant that will follow your cursor when clicked
3. Further optimisation for low-connectivity
4. A print mode to enable printing off all pages
